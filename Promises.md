# Callback function :

### A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.The benefit of using a callback function is that you can wait for the result of a previous function call and then execute another function call.

# Async/Await :

### An Async function is a function declared with the async keyword.
### Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result.

# Promises

### Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
