## In React, a Bus Event is a way to communicate between components that are not directly related to each other. It involves using a centralized event bus, which is an object that acts as a mediator between components.

>Here is an example of how to use a Bus Event in React:

```
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import EventEmitter from "events";

const BusEvent = new EventEmitter();

function ComponentA() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to the Bus Event in ComponentA
    BusEvent.addListener("exampleEvent", handleEvent);

    return () => {
      // Unsubscribe from the Bus Event when ComponentA unmounts
      BusEvent.removeListener("exampleEvent", handleEvent);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleEvent() {
    // Handle the Bus Event in ComponentA
    console.log("ComponentA received the Bus Event");
  }

  return <div>ComponentA</div>;
}

function ComponentB() {
  function handleClick() {
    // Emit the Bus Event when ComponentB is clicked
    BusEvent.emit("exampleEvent");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>ComponentB</button>;
}


```

In this example, we create a Bus Event object called BusEvent using the EventEmitter class from the events module. We then define two functional components: ComponentA and ComponentB.

ComponentA uses the useEffect hook to subscribe to the Bus Event in its callback function. It also uses the useEffect hook's cleanup function to unsubscribe from the Bus Event when the component unmounts. When the Bus Event is emitted, ComponentA handles the event by executing the handleEvent function.

ComponentB uses a regular function to define its handleClick event handler. When the button is clicked, ComponentB emits the Bus Event by executing the emit method on the BusEvent object.

Overall, this is a simple example of how to use a Bus Event in a functional component in React. The code is very similar to the class component example I provided earlier, but with some syntax differences due to the functional component paradigm.
