## In React, a Bus Event is a way to communicate between components that are not directly related to each other. It involves using a centralized event bus, which is an object that acts as a mediator between components.

>Here is an example of how to use a Bus Event in React:

```
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import EventEmitter from "events";

const BusEvent = new EventEmitter();

function ComponentA() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to the Bus Event in ComponentA
    BusEvent.addListener("exampleEvent", handleEvent);

    return () => {
      // Unsubscribe from the Bus Event when ComponentA unmounts
      BusEvent.removeListener("exampleEvent", handleEvent);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleEvent() {
    // Handle the Bus Event in ComponentA
    console.log("ComponentA received the Bus Event");
  }

  return <div>ComponentA</div>;
}

function ComponentB() {
  function handleClick() {
    // Emit the Bus Event when ComponentB is clicked
    BusEvent.emit("exampleEvent");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>ComponentB</button>;
}


```
